# The Awesome Plex  Server

Want to access the old guide with picutres? http://doc.plexguide.com (Warning Semi Dated)

This guide will enable you to run a plex service, create and run many mass services at once, and download and upload through USENET.  Fully works solo my automated server with minimimal maintence.  This incorporates the full power of Docker.  

Note: Recommend to install PlexDrive 4 and 5.  Wrote up guy that allow easy install of both. PD4 right now is working 100x better than PD5.  The YML is written up so all you have to do is change a number and your Plex won't even notice (it's a good thing).

The Following Items Will Be Installed:

  - Plex & PlexyPy & Ombi
  - RClone & PlexDrive 5 xor 4
  - Docker, Docker Compose, and Portainer
  - Sonarr & CouchPotato + 2 Instances of SABNZBD; one for each
  - NetData & MuxiMux

The Awesome Plex Server Is Based on the USE OF:

  - Ubuntu 16.04
  - Google Drive (G-Suite)
  - If Downloading - USENET
  - Remote Server; works for local also (use dyndns and a ddwrt router to access your service outside of your local server)

# Who It's Written For:

  - For Noobs and Novice Noobs like me
  - For those who just want to learned and improve their setup


Not For:
  - Cranky Linux Experts
  - Closed Minded Individuals
  - Non-Solution Oriented Anti-Team Personality Types

Feel free to point out issues, suggestions, and even testing this guide and adding to it.  Full credit will be given.  All I care about is putting together some information that's scattered all over the web and making life easier through an automated setup.

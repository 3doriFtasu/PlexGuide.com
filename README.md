# The Awesome Plex  Server

Want to access the old guide with pictures? http://doc.plexguide.com (Warning Semi Dated / good for pictures / bad for install)

This guide will enable you to run a plex service, create and run many mass programs at once, and download-upload utilizing USENET.  This fully works on my server with minimimal maintence.  This incorporates the full power of Docker.  

In regards to encryption, this document serves as a baseline and fully works.  If you want to use encrytion, SSL, and etc; you will have to GENERATE YOUR OWN SOLUTIONS.  If you have a solution and wish to share it, I will add it.  Go to the bottom of this README.

Note: Recommend to install PlexDrive 4 and 5.  Wrote up this guide that allows an easy install of both. PD4 right now is working 100x better than PD5 in my use (and another confirmed by a user who did the same).  The YML is written up so all you have to do is change a number and your Plex won't even notice (it's a good thing).

The Following Items Will Be Installed:

  - Plex & PlexyPy & Ombi
  - RClone & PlexDrive 5 xor 4
  - Docker, Docker Compose, and Portainer
  - Sonarr & CouchPotato + 2 Instances of SABNZBD; one for each
  - NetData & MuxiMux

The Awesome Plex Server Is Based on the USE OF:

  - Ubuntu 16.04
  - Google Drive (G-Suite)
  - If Downloading - USENET
  - Remote Server; works for local also (use dyndns and a ddwrt router to access your service outside of your local server)

# Who It's Written For:

  - For Noobs and Novice Noobs like me
  - For those who just want to learned and improve their setup


Not For:
  - Cranky Linux Experts
  - Closed Minded Individuals
  - Non-Solution Oriented Anti-Team Personality Types

Feel free to point out issues, suggestions, and even testing this guide and adding to it.  Full credit will be given.  All I care about is putting together some information that's scattered all over the web and making life easier through an automated setup.

# Want to Help?:

Take the guide and write up the set of instructions and send a link.  I'll post the credit to you (and test of course).

### Possible Encryption Solutions:
Note, I do not use services; use rd.local so be aware you will have to ensure you modify to ensure everything works properly.

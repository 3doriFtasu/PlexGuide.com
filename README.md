http://manual.plexguide.com

## Mission Statement
To build an automated setup through ease of use to ensure that you are maintaing a steady and uncomplicated server; while maintaing your media up-to-date through the use of USENET.

## Purpose
The script installs plex and other programs to create simplistic use.  The script follows the logic of the manual methods, which you can study and learn).  This was made as a result of poor plexcloud performance and Google API bans.  This enables you to have an automated server that upload and downloads with your Google Drive mounted.  Basically, you eliminate all of the hard-drives that are sitting around and you can play from multiple plex servers with the same google mount!

### What's Installing & What Required

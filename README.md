## Mission Statement
To build an automated setup through ease of use to ensure that you are maintaing a steady and uncomplicated server; while maintaing your media up-to-date through the use of USENET.

## Purpose
The script install plex and many other programs for simplistic use.  The script follows the logic of the manual method (s you can study and learn).  This was made as a result of poor plexcloud performance and Google API bans.  This enables you to have an automated server that upload and downloads with your Google Drive mounted.  Basically, you eliminate all of the hard-drives that are sitting around and you can play from multiple plex servers with the same google mount!

### What's Installing & What Required
- Docker, NetData, Ombi, PlexDrive4, Plex, PlexPy, Muximux, Radarr, SABNZBD, Sonarr
- Google Drive, Ubunt 16.04 and USENET Indexers and Servers

#### What's up with Version 3.5?
Version 3.5 will become 4.0 when finished.  Version 3.5 is now incorporating PROGRAMMING.

# The Awesome Plex Server
http://doc.plexguide.com - Until the GITHUB Transition is complete  (more stuff and pictures)

DESIGNED FOR:  Ubuntu 16.04 & Google Drive + USENET

Wanted: If you have tips for security, please message me on Reddit or note on one the forums.  Info such as iptables, fixing bad commands, and etc will help.  Send a PM on Reddit to Admin9705.

Disclosure: Links provided are direct links (not referrals and etc).  Suggestions made are based on extensive experience; not due to a bias preference.  This guide is just to help out noobs like me and you, but it’s always good to DOCUMENT everything you do; especially LINUX (you’ll spend hours backtracking a simple lost command).  

Guide is NOT for the old-timers whose goal is to criticize without offering a solution.  Offer solutions - you were a noob once!

WARNING:  This is not designed for Torrents.  It’s designed for USENET.  Read my extensive FAQ [here].  If you fail to do so or understand what USENET is, you will download nothing.  USENET is much faster.  Again, read the USENET info.

What You Will Install:  Plex, PlexDrive 5, RClone v1.36, Sonnar, Portainer, Docker, Screen, & NetData, SABNZBD, CouchPotato

Note:  Radarr info will be put in Guide 3.2 - Taking a break for awhile. Couchpotato works great for scanning a current massive library that you own.  Radarr is not.

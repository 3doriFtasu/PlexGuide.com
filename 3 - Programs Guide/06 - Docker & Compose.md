# Docker Basics
Provide some quick info regarding docker

- Docker is free to use
- Docker runs it's mini VM's for programs; not as a whole OS
- Barely taxes your system as how VMWare does; including ESXI
- No processor limitation compared to VMWare
- If one program goes down, reboot that container; not the entire server
- Create mass programs with mass installs from the execution of a YML file
- Does not offer a GUI, but Portainer does

## Installing Docker & Compose

```sh
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
sudo apt install docker-compose
```

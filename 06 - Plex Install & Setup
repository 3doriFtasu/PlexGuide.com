### Plex Setup

# If you can access our plex server via a VM or interface, you can probably access it. Scroll down to Plex Optimization.
# Setup a remote PLEX server or a headless machine and cannot access your PLEX Server? Read the info below
# You cannot access or setup anything if your plex is not on a LOCAL MACHINE (meaning remote)

### Required
# Windows Machine & Putty
# MAC Users - You'll need to find your own solution.  VMWare with Window is great for MAC Users.

### Creating a tunnel to access your remote machine
# Load putty
# Type in your remote-ipaddress and port 22 and select SSH
# On the left side of the menu expand CONNECTION > SSH > Tunnels
#  - Source Port: 6969
#  - Destination: remote-ipaddress:32400
#  - [Click] Open
#  - Login and keep the terminal putty open
#
### Linux tunnel ### (found at https://www.howtogeek.com/168145/how-to-use-ssh-tunneling/)
# Open command line terminal
# Use 'ssh -L local_port:remote_address:remote_port username@server.com' to access remote server
# ssh -L 6969:xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:32400 bob@ssh.youroffice.com or bob@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx ('xxx' being the ip of your server and change 'bob' to your username)
#
# Open your browser (Chrome best choice)
#  - Type: http://localhost:6969/web or (if you forget the web part, you will get a whole bunch of XML garbage)
#  - You will now be able to setup PLEX
#  - Double check by opening a new window or tab and type http://ipv4address:32400/web

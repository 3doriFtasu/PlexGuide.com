###### Basic Directions
1. Create a folder at C: and call it vmstart (C:/vmstart)
2. Windows 10 - Up top, click view and ensure [File Name Extensions] are checked
3. Goto C:/vmstart and right click... new text file
4. Open that text file and make the following two lines below (view: How mine is setup)

Example:
### Warning, goto the path below and make sure VM Workstation is installed there, if not, change it out to where you installed IT!!!!
cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\VMware Workstation"
### Warning, make sure your location of your VM file is correct; look at mine as a demo
vmware -x "location-of-your-vm\name-of-your-vm.vmx"

How mine is setup:
cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\VMware Workstation"
vmware -x "D:\vm-download\Ubuntu 64-bit.vmx"

5. Save the text item
6. Right click and rename and change the .txt to .bat

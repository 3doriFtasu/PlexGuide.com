# wordpressuser: recommend to change to what you can remember
# password: change password to something strong and that you can remember!!!
GRANT ALL ON wordpress.* TO 'wordpressuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

# Exit MYSQL
EXIT;

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install php-curl php-gd php-mbstring php-mcrypt php-xml php-xmlrpc
sudo systemctl restart apache2

# Enable .htaccess overrides
sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

# Add this to the very bottom of the file
<Directory /var/www/html/>
    AllowOverride All
</Directory>
# Press CTRL+X to save

# Enable rewrite module
sudo a2enmod rewrite

# Check for errors, should say [OK]
sudo apache2ctl configtest

# Restart the APACHE server due to configuration changes
sudo systemctl restart apache2sudo systemctl restart apache2

# Download Wordpress to TMP Folder for Install (Can copy and paste entire block)
cd /tmp
curl -O https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
tar xzvf latest.tar.gz
touch /tmp/wordpress/.htaccess
chmod 660 /tmp/wordpress/.htaccess
cp /tmp/wordpress/wp-config-sample.php /tmp/wordpress/wp-config.php
mkdir /tmp/wordpress/wp-content/upgrade
sudo cp -a /tmp/wordpress/. /var/www/html

# Assigning Permissions - Note: Change the YOURUSERNAME line below - You can copy and paste entire block after
sudo chown -R YOURUSERNAME:www-data /var/www/html
sudo find /var/www/html -type d -exec chmod g+s {} \;
sudo chmod g+w /var/www/html/wp-content
sudo chmod -R g+w /var/www/html/wp-content/themes
sudo chmod -R g+w /var/www/html/wp-content/plugins

### Securing your Config File
# Type the following to generate SALT values (it's security stuff)
curl -s https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/

# Take the output and copy into a wordpad and then type
sudo nano/var/www/html/wp-config.php

# Scroll down several lines until you see tons of define lines, delete the default crap and paste each one of your values in
# Now scroll back up and enter your configuration information; the ones you REMEMBERED from your MYSQL setup
# Change only DB_NAME, DB_USER, and DB_PASSWORD only!
# Press CTRL+X and Save

### Finishing Up
# Now type your http://ipv4address|domain
# You should now see a wordpress install
# If you receive a CONNECTION ERROR, double check your password, username, and database name; trust me... I had to redo twice
# For wordpress, create a strong username and password! Trust me, I was hacked in 2006 with weak info (luckly the site wasn't started)

# Upgrade Wordpress - Wordpress will not upgrade for security reasons, so if you need to ever upgrade run this line
sudo chown -R www-data /var/www/html

# Once done, lock it back down - Tip: Change YOURUSERNAME
sudo chown -R YOURUSERNAME /var/www/html

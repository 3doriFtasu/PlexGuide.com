## Run rclone config again and create a LOCAL STORAGE, I just called it local

## These are notes to incorporate once testing is done
## Purpose is to change how data is written via rclone
## This methods prevents the upload ban and utilizes a DATA MOVE rather than a direct write

## To install fuse
sudo apt-get install unionfs-fuse

## future directory for sonarr, radarr, and couch potato to write to
unionfs /mnt/rclone-move=RW:/mnt/rclone=RO /mnt/rclone-union

## Create a test write file
touch /mnt/rclone-union/zzz.file1

## Check that it in the sync/move folder
ls /mnt/rclone-move
## should see the file, that's good if there

## Now check to see if you see it in unionfs
ls /mnt/rclone-union/zilch
## if that file is there, that's great also

## command to move data
## need to incorporate a script and cron job to ensure it keeps acting starting every hour if not running
rclone move --bwlimit 10M --tpslimit 8 --max-size 99G --log-level INFO --stats 15s local:/mnt/rclone-move gdrive:/zilch/

## to see if data moved
ls /mnt/rclone/zilch
## if the file is there, everything worked great! the directory your looking at is purely the cloud drive - meaning data moved.

## These are notes to incorporate once testing is done
## Purpose is to change how data is written via rclone
## This methods prevents the upload ban and utilizes a DATA MOVE rather than a direct write

## To install fuse
sudo apt-get install unionfs-fuse

## future directory for sonarr, radarr, and couch potato to write to
unionfs /mnt/rclone-move=RW:/mnt/rclone=RO /mnt/rclone-union

## command to move data
## need to incorporate a script and cron job to ensure it keeps acting starting every hour if not running
rclone move --bwlimit 10M --tpslimit 8 --max-size 99G --log-level INFO --stats 15s local:/mnt/rclone-move gdrive:/zilch/

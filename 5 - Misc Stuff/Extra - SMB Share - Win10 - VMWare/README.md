# Purpose & Reasoning

Allows you to run PLEX on Windows and enables PLEX to scan against a networked/mapped Linux Drive
You can run two plex servers; one on your Windows machine & Linux; upside is you have two! 
You can disable or not run linux one
Depedning on your machine, this may run a little slow for Plex on the Windows side.

### What about VMWare ESXI?
If your running ESXI, your smart enough to read through this and adjust accordingly.  It will work.

### Why this?
So if you run a linux emulator, you'll notice you'll never get your TRUE processing power
So creating a VM just for PLEXDRIVE is better and your PLEX can scan against the VM PlexDrive

### Requirements
Windows & VM Workstation 
Know how to create a linux emualator

### What you need to do!
Run VM Workstation
Create a UBUNTU 16.04 emulator
Install Server Guide stuff from part 2 stuff.  You can ignore linux plex setup if you want
 Ensure you assign a STATIC IP Address to your LINUX machine - You need for your networked share

I would recommend PD4 over 5

Reasons:
PD4 does not stop; PD5 scans with plex are bad and will tend to stop
PD4 never requires a reboot; PD5 requires lot of reboots for large scans
PD4 is insanely stable
Same reasonings have been confirmed by another user

Only install 1

You can install both and set up the YML to change between both; but just stick with 4.

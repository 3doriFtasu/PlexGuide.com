I would recommend the following as Plex Servers (All from Personal Experience)

Dedicated Servers:
PROS: More horsepower, more diskspace, better control, better bandwidth
CONS: Costs more

1. http://wholesaleinternet.com
  * Server Dual Xeon 2670 (16core/32thread)
  * RAM 32GB - 96GB
  * Solid State Drives
  * Costs: $69-$99
  * 100TB up and down dedicated bandwidth
  * PROS:
    - Bandwidth:  Reach 150 MB (1.5gpbs speeds)
    - It's dual core server for under $100
    - Easy to use
    - Takes Paypal
    - NOT BANNED by indexers or anybody else
    - (Great for US Customers) You pay in dollars
  * CONS:
    - Slightly less options
    - DO NOT PICK CUSTOM servers!!! If you do, you'll have to put in tickets to hard reboot
2. Online.net
  * Xeons Processors
  * RAM 32+
  * Solid State & HD Drives
  * Costs: Nutty costs for dual core, single core Xeons around $29-99; 8-15 for ATOMS (do not recommend)
  * Bandwidth: Unlimited, reached 90 MB speeds (.9gbps)
  * PROS:
    - Sales: Super cheap on sales
    - Interface: Very good with lots of options
    - Bandwidth: Top notch
    - NOT BANNED by indexers or anybody else
  * CONS:
    - If you do not cancel by the 20th of the month, they bill you next month
    - Requires identity verification
    - Only takes Credit Cards
    - (Bad for US Customers) EURO GOES up, so does your costs
3. Hetzner.de
  * Xeon, Desktop, and AMD Processors
  * RAM - All types
  * Solid State & HD Drives
  * Costs: $20+
  * 30TB outgoing bandwidth, unlimited incoming
  * PROS
    - Bandwidth unlimited incoming is great; to balance against the 30TB outgoing
    - Takes Paypal
    - Can use auctioned servers or custom
    - Customer service is very fast
    - Can setup servers and not pay for 14 days and cancel, great for newbs
  * CONS
    - Interface can be semi-confusing (worst if all brand new to everything)
    - Half download companies ban HETZNER due to abuse such as Giganews and Supernews; several others
    - Bandwidth good, but never reach the highest speeds; still good
    - Customer server packages get pricy

VPS Servers:
PROS: Cheaper
CONS: Less horsepower, less diskspace, semi-ok control, semi-ok bandwidth

I have not used one because of plex server processing requirements, but http://online.net and http://hetzner.de offer VPS

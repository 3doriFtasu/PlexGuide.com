## What is IDM CC?
 
IDM CC is an extension that integrates Internet Download Manager (IDM) into Firefox and other browsers. IDM is a popular download manager that can accelerate your downloads by up to 5 times, resume broken downloads, schedule downloads, and manage your downloads in categories. IDM also supports various protocols, such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, MMS, and RTSP.
 
IDM CC allows you to download files with IDM from your browser. It adds a "Download with IDM" option to the context menu of links and a "Download panel" to the web page of video and audio files. It also helps to intercept downloads from other applications, such as media players or web players.
 
## Why do you need IDM CC for Firefox 7.0.1?
 
If you are using Firefox 7.0.1 or an older version of Firefox, you may need IDM CC to download files with IDM from your browser. This is because the newer versions of IDM CC are not compatible with the older versions of Firefox. The latest version of IDM CC only works with Firefox 53 and above.

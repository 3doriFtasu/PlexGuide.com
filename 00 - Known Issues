- If you reboot you server, you must use docker http://ipv4address:9000 and reboot couchpotato and sonnar one time only
 - for some reason, the containers are much faster than rclone, so they fail to see the rclone directories
 - Fix is to find a way to delay container startups or a script to reboot them, until then; just be aware

### Purpose & Reasoning
# Allows you to run PLEX on Windows and enables PLEX to scan against a networked/mapped Linux Drive
# You can run two plex servers; one on your Windows machine & Linux; upside is you have two! You can disable or not run linux one

### Why this?
# So if you run a linux emulator, you'll notice you'll never get your TRUE processing power
# So creating a VM just for PLEXDRIVE is better and your PLEX can scan against the VM PlexDrive

### Requirements
Windows & VM Workstation 
Know how to create a linux emualator
